  <p>At City Chiropractic Care we are committed to providing the highest quality health care in a friendly and professional setting. We firmly believe in an overall wellness approach to health. The body naturally seeks a balance among all its systems and we believe that chiropractic is the way to restore the natural balance your body seeks and to optimise the health of the whole human system.</p>
  <p>Each segment of your spine should enjoy a certain range of movement. Spinal restrictions can cause localised muscle spasms and back pain most commonly associated with the need for chiropractic care. They can also have much more far reaching consequences to your nervous system leading to headaches, neck pain, joint pain and non-musculoskeletal conditions including allergies and digestive disorders.</p>
  <p>We focus on restoring, preserving and optimizing your health through gentle, safe and specific adjustments to spinal joint restrictions. We pride ourselves on the thoroughness of our approach and manner in which we deliver our services. Our reward comes from seeing patients attain great results from their spinal care.</p>
